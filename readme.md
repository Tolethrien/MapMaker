## Level Editor

this is prototype of a level editor for 2d tiled based map

Editor UI is made in solid.js

rendering and engine stuff are all my tech from misa engine

app is made in electron to use native on windows

## Idea

The editor allows the creation of game worlds built from tiles directly on the map canvas. It includes features such as cameras, dynamic object generation, lighting, and a day-night cycle to "feel" the atmosphere of the scene.

The map will be exported as a binary file (the reading method will be described in the documentation). It also supports exporting files with objects created in the editor, such as chests, candles, and NPCs to recreate them in Misa engine.
